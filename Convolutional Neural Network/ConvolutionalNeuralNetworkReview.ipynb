Instead of rewriting pieces of code everytime that you would, a good student is encouraged to code using functional programming, keeping the code organized, clear and concise.\n",

This is a totally general purpose connection pattern and makes no assumptions about the features in the input data thus not using any advantage that the knowledge of the data being used can bring. These types of layers are also very expensive in terms of memory and computation.\n",

    "In contrast, in a convolutional layer each neuron is only connected to a few nearby local neurons in the previous layer, and the same set of weights is used to connect to them. For example, in the following image, the neurons in the h1 layer are connected only to some input units (pixels).\n",
