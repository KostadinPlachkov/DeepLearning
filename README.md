# Deep Learning

Deep learning (also known as deep structured
learning or hierarchical learning) is part of
a broader family of machine learning methods
based on learning data representations, as opposed
to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be
supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning models are loosely related to information
processing and communication patterns in a biological
nervous system, such as neural coding that attempts
to define a relationship between various stimuli 
and associated neuronal responses in the brain.

Deep learning architectures such as deep neural
networks, deep belief networks and recurrent 
neural networks have been applied to fields
including computer vision, speech recognition,
natural language processing, audio recognition, 
social network filtering, machine translation, 
bioinformatics and drug design, where they have 
produced results comparable to and in some cases 
superior to human experts.
